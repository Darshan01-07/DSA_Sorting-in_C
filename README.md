## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science and plays a vital role in data processing. This repository provides efficient implementations of various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. These algorithms can be used to sort arrays of elements in ascending or descending order.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Advanced Bubble Sort

The Advanced Bubble Sort is an improved version of the traditional Bubble Sort algorithm, which is known for its simplicity but can be inefficient for large datasets. The advanced version includes optimizations that make it more practical for real-world use.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is often used in practice for small datasets and is known for its simplicity and efficiency for nearly sorted data.

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a widely used and highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It is known for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n) and is often used in various applications.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted portion of the array and moves it to the sorted portion.

### Traditional Bubble Sort

The Traditional Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms, but it is not very efficient for large datasets. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Getting Started

To get started with these sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-sorting-c.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd dsa-sorting-c
   ```

3. Compile the C code for the desired sorting algorithm using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):

   ```shell
   gcc advanced_bubble_sort.c -o advanced_bubble_sort
   ```

4. Execute the compiled program:

   ```shell
   ./advanced_bubble_sort
   ```

   Replace `advanced_bubble_sort` with the name of the sorting algorithm you want to run.

## How to Use

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C file. To use a specific sorting algorithm, compile the corresponding C file and run the compiled executable. Follow the instructions in the "Getting Started" section for more details.
